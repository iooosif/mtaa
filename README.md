# MOBILE TECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS
**GROUP**: iooosif, mautin_pomanicky

### FaceSTU
Social media application developed by students for students. If you are new, lost or have time to kill (ofcourse you do) join our app and post unrestricted and uncensored insights from your day-to-day life. Lead a blog, create a thread, have the intention to help others. Create events, invitations, group chats, post schoolwork, get help with schoolwork. Anything a student needs in one place.

### Tech used
#### Frontend
- Cross-platform development (Flutter/Kotlin Multiplatform)

Since _iooosif_ has experience in Kotlin and _mautin_ previously worked with Flutter, there is a decision to be made which technology is going to be used to develop the frontend of this project. They both share similarities and have their differences. Tough choice.
#### Backend
Pretty straight-forward, JavaScript backend with ExpressJS API and postgreSQL running on in separate docker container. ExpressJS provides easy to use and lightweight backend framework, though missing ORM but I guesss we can manage.
#### Firebase
We should use Firebase as it is in optional requirements :)
